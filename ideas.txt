Works with many and large image files with long loading times.

Isn't very easy to add new elements to the poll currently.

**Ideas for future:**


//insert in canvas.php in the javascript loop where it's creating all the bars
//Grab data from database
<?php
$result = mysql_query("SELECT SUM(NULLIF(ada ,0)) FROM Legends") or die(mysql_error());
$legend_data = mysql_result($result,0);
?>;
var votes = <?php echo json_encode($legend_data); ?>;



<?php

mysql_connect('localhost', 'root', '');
if (!mysql_select_db('mydb')) {
    echo("creating database!\n");
    mysql_query('CREATE DATABASE mydb');
    mysql_select_db('mydb');
}

?>
